A. The conditional test in the code always succeeds because since the sizeof operator returns a value of type size_t, it is never negative since size_t is an unsigned type. Since size_t is unsigned, the expression will be evaluated as unsigned, hence, it will never be negative and will always be true.

B.

void copy_int(int val, void *buf, int maxbytes) {
    if (maxbytes - (int) sizeof(val) >= 0)
	memcpy(buf, (void *) &val, sizeof(val));
}
